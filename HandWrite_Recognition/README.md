This ML algorithm recognizes handwriting digits from 0 - 9.
It prefers images with background black and digit white with size 28 * 28.

To use the recognizer:
  First Run the file 'Learn.m' to train the Neural Network
  and then enter into terminal the name of the image you want to predict(e.g 'example.jpg') 
  afterwards if you still want to predict run the file predictUserInput.
  (The learning process might take a minute or two)
