This ML algorithm recognises handwriting digits from 0 - 9. It prefers images with background black and digit white with size 28 * 28.

The input data is modified from original MNIST data by rotation/reflection in order to make it look like the digit.

To use the recogniser: First Run the file 'Learn.m' to train the Neural Network and then enter into terminal the name of the image you want to predict(e.g 'example.jpg') afterwards if you still want to predict images, run the file 'predictUserInput'. (The learning process might take about five minutes)
